Hello we are the B.O.Y.S and are professions vary from one and another, a full time developer making a living from this new and dynamic medium, and the other is a Senior assosiate in one of the big firms and our passion towards technology has driven a lot.

A dream to write the best articles possible. We know this is just going to be my start, but achieving one's goal is not far behind.The idea of launching B.O.Y.S was a dream come true for us when we realized that we can't repeat the job cycle on a daily basis.

Bored out youngsters(B.O.Y.S)would be all about fun filled articles and interesting topics covered in and around the city. We know there are some awesome blogger out there who put there entire effort in one blog post, but we don't care we will try to bring the fun element in every post.

We will keep ourselfs pumped up so that you could have some gigs.
